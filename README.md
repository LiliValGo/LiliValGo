# Hi there, I'm Lili Valencia 

üíö I'm an Environmental Engineer  turned Data Analyst with aspirations to become a Data Engineer. I have experience in data manipulation, analysis, and visualization using Python + Libraries, SQL, and Power BI. I've explored some concepts and models of machine learning ü¶æ.

üë©‚Äçüíª In my free time, I actively participate in communities of various technological stacks. 

üå± I'm currently learning [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/), SQL Server Analysis Services, and SQL Server Integration Services.

## Some of my projects
* üìÑ [NLP Analysis of UN Climate Change Reports](https://github.com/LiliValGo/NLP-Analysis-of-UN-Climate-Change-Reports)

 This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze large amounts of textual data from UN reports on climate change. By applying NLP, the project aims to extract valuable information that can shed light on critical aspects of climate change.

* üë©‚Äçüî¨ [IRCA - Water Quality Classification Program in Rust](https://github.com/LiliValGo/Irca-Rust)
  
This program implements the IRCA (√çndice de Riesgo de Calidad del Agua) water quality classification system as defined by Colombian üá®üá¥ RESOLUCION 2115 DE 2007
* üåΩ [Colombia Crop Yield Prediction](https://github.com/LiliValGo/ML_Time_Series)
  
This project uses time series data to predict corn crop yield in Colombia üá®üá¥

* ‚öíÔ∏è [Analysis of Coal Production in Colombia](https://github.com/LiliValGo/Coal-Production-Colombia)

Data analysis that includes information on annual coal production, royalties generated, and climate variables. Descriptive analysis and visual analysis techniques were used
