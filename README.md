# Hi there, I'm Lili Valencia 

💚 I'm an Environmental Engineer  turned Data Analyst with aspirations to become a Data Engineer. I have experience in data manipulation, analysis, and visualization using Python + Libraries, SQL, and Power BI. I've explored some concepts and models of machine learning 🦾.

👩‍💻 In my free time, I actively participate in communities of various technological stacks. 

🌱 I'm currently learning [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/), SQL Server Analysis Services, and SQL Server Integration Services.
